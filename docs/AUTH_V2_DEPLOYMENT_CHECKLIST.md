## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify all services are running
docker compose ps

# 2. Check service health
curl http://localhost:3008/health  # auth-v2-service
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # auth-service (old)
curl http://localhost:3002/archive/health  # archive-service
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # assessment-service
curl http://localhost:3006/health  # chatbot-service

# 3. Verify database connectivity
docker exec atma-postgres psql -U atma_user -d atma_db -c "SELECT 1;"

# 4. Check Redis connectivity
docker exec atma-redis redis-cli ping
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All services healthy
- [ ] Database connected
- [ ] Redis connected
- [ ] No errors in logs

---

### Step 2: Create Backup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
./scripts/backup-database.sh deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Verify backup created
ls -lh backups/
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Backup created successfully
- [ ] Backup file size reasonable (>1MB)
- [ ] Backup metadata file created
- [ ] Backup verified with sample query

---

### Step 3: Deploy Auth-v2-Service (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Ensure auth-v2-service is running
docker compose up -d auth-v2-service

# 2. Wait for service to be healthy
sleep 10

# 3. Verify health
curl http://localhost:3008/health

# 4. Check logs for errors
docker compose logs --tail=50 auth-v2-service
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Service started successfully
- [ ] Health check passing
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Redis connection established
- [ ] Firebase initialized

---

### Step 4: Test Authentication (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"deployment-test@example.com",
    "password":"TestPassword123!",
    "username":"DeploymentTest"
  }'

# 2. Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"deployment-test@example.com",
    "password":"TestPassword123!"
  }'

# 3. Test token verification (use token from login response)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/v1/token/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"<TOKEN_FROM_LOGIN>"}'
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Registration successful
- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Token verification successful
- [ ] User created in database
- [ ] User has correct auth_provider (firebase)

---

### Step 5: Test Service Integration (10 minutes)

```bash
# Test with archive service
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/archive/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

# Test with assessment service
curl -X GET http://localhost:3003/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

# Test with chatbot service
curl -X GET http://localhost:3006/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Archive service integration working
- [ ] Assessment service integration working
- [ ] Chatbot service integration working
- [ ] Token verification working across services

---

### Step 6: Verify Database State (5 minutes)

```bash
# Check user count
docker exec atma-postgres psql -U atma_user -d atma_db -c "
  SELECT auth_provider, COUNT(*) 
  FROM auth.users 
  GROUP BY auth_provider;
"

# Check new user
docker exec atma-postgres psql -U atma_user -d atma_db -c "
  SELECT id, email, username, auth_provider, firebase_uid IS NOT NULL as has_firebase_uid
  FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email = 'deployment-test@example.com';
"
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] User count correct
- [ ] New user created with firebase provider
- [ ] Firebase UID populated
- [ ] No data corruption

---

### Step 7: Monitor Logs (15 minutes)

```bash
# Monitor all service logs
docker compose logs -f auth-v2-service auth-service \
  archive-service assessment-service chatbot-service
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] No errors in auth-v2-service logs
- [ ] No errors in dependent service logs
- [ ] Authentication requests successful
- [ ] Token verification requests successful

---

### Step 8: Performance Verification (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run performance tests
# (Use your performance testing tool)

# Check response times
# Target: <200ms (p95) for token verification
# Target: <50ms (p95) for cached verification
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Response times within targets
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Cache hit rate >90%
- [ ] Database query times <100ms
