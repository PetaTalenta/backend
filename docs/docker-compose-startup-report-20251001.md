## API Gateway Health Check
- ✅ API Gateway responding correctly at http://localhost:3000/health
- ✅ Service routing working properly

## Analysis Workers
- ✅ Both analysis workers started successfully
- ✅ Connected to RabbitMQ and consuming messages
- ✅ DLQ monitoring active (7 failed messages in queue, below threshold of 10)
- ⚠️ Minor authentication issue with stuck job check (does not affect core functionality)

## Network Connectivity
- ✅ All services communicating properly
- ✅ Database connections established
- ✅ Inter-service communication working
- ✅ Message queue processing active

## Notes
1. Warnings about obsolete `version` attribute in docker-compose files can be safely ignored
2. Analysis workers had initial connection issues but were resolved after restart
3. All services are healthy and responding to requests
4. Ready for testing with test accounts:
   - Regular user: kasykoi@gmail.com / Anjas123
   - Admin user: superadmin / admin123

## Recommendations
1. Consider removing the deprecated `version` attribute from docker-compose.yml files
2. Monitor the DLQ for failed analysis jobs
3. Investigate the authentication issue with stuck job monitoring (non-critical)

## Conclusion
✅ **All services are running successfully and the system is ready for use.**
