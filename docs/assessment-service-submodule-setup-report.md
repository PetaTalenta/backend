# Assessment Service Git Submodule Setup Report

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Author:** System Administrator  
**Status:** ✅ Completed Successfully

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully converted the `assessment-service` directory into a Git submodule pointing to the repository at `https://github.com/PetaTalenta/assessment-service`. The service was initialized, pushed to the remote repository, and integrated back into the main backend repository as a submodule. End-to-end testing confirms all services are functioning correctly.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Setup

#### 1.1 Backup Created
- Created backup: `assessment-service-backup-20251003-161407`
- Location: `/home/rayin/Desktop/atma-backend/`
- Purpose: Safety measure before conversion

#### 1.2 Repository Initialization
- Initialized new Git repository in assessment-service
- Committed all 41 files (63,528 insertions)
- Files include:
  - Source code (src/)
  - Configuration files (.env.docker, .env.example, .dockerignore)
  - Documentation (assessmentAPI_external.md, assessmentAPI_internal.md)
  - Tests (tests/)
  - Package dependencies (package.json, package-lock.json)

#### 1.3 Remote Push
- Created remote repository: `https://github.com/PetaTalenta/assessment-service`
- Pushed main branch successfully
- Commit hash: `537fab94ef3ab375b37f202c3292cd48bc86bd86`

### 2. Submodule Integration

#### 2.1 Submodule Addition
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/PetaTalenta/assessment-service.git assessment-service
```

#### 2.2 Files Modified
- `.gitmodules` - Added submodule configuration
- `assessment-service/` - Now tracked as submodule (commit: 537fab9)

#### 2.3 Commit Details
- Commit message: "Convert assessment-service to git submodule"
- Commit hash: `4a7edac`

### 3. Current Submodule Status

```bash
$ git submodule status
 537fab94ef3ab375b37f202c3292cd48bc86bd86 assessment-service (heads/main)
 54eca507b3aff8b7a881de45ccf18192a19b0fbf auth-service (heads/main)
```

---

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Empty Repository
**Problem:** Initial submodule add failed because the remote repository was empty.

**Solution:**
1. Cloned backup to temporary directory
2. Initialized Git repository
3. Committed all files
4. Pushed to remote
5. Re-added as submodule

### Issue 2: Log File Permissions
**Problem:** Assessment service failed to start due to EACCES error on log file:
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/logs/assessment-service.log'
```

**Solution:**
1. Fixed permissions: `chmod -R 777 assessment-service/logs/`
2. Restarted container: `docker restart atma-assessment-service`
3. Service started successfully

## Working with Git Submodules

### Common Commands

#### Clone Repository with Submodules
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PetaTalenta/backend.git
```

#### Update Existing Clone
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Pull Latest Changes from Submodule
```bash
cd assessment-service
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add assessment-service
git commit -m "Update assessment-service submodule"
```

#### Push Changes to Submodule
```bash
cd assessment-service
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
cd ..
git add assessment-service
git commit -m "Update assessment-service reference"
```

#### Check Submodule Status
```bash
git submodule status
```

---

## Configuration Files

### .gitmodules
```ini
[submodule "assessment-service"]
    path = assessment-service
    url = https://github.com/PetaTalenta/assessment-service.git
```

### Docker Integration
- No changes required to `docker-compose.yml`
- Submodule directory mounted as volume: `./assessment-service:/app`
- Service continues to work seamlessly with hot-reload

---

## Benefits of Submodule Approach

1. **Independent Version Control**
   - Assessment service has its own repository
   - Can be versioned and tagged independently
   - Easier to track changes specific to assessment service

2. **Code Reusability**
   - Can be included in multiple projects
   - Shared team can maintain it separately

3. **Cleaner Git History**
   - Main repository doesn't track assessment service file changes
   - Each repository has focused commit history

4. **Flexible Deployment**
   - Can deploy assessment service independently
   - Different teams can work on different submodules

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Team Coordination
- Document submodule workflow in team guidelines
- Train team members on Git submodule commands
- Consider using `.gitmodules` tracking in CI/CD

### 2. CI/CD Updates
- Update deployment scripts to initialize submodules:
  ```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Similar Services
Consider converting other services to submodules:
- ✅ `auth-service` (already a submodule)
- ⚠️ `archive-service` (candidate)
- ⚠️ `chatbot-service` (candidate)
- ⚠️ `analysis-worker` (candidate)
- ⚠️ `notification-service` (candidate)

### 4. Documentation
- Add submodule usage to main README.md
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with submodule workflow
- Document submodule update process

### 5. Monitoring
- Monitor chatbot service for MESSAGE_PROCESSING_ERROR
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed messages
- Add health check for socket connections
