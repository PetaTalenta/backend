## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Cache Effectiveness

**First Request (Cache Miss):**
```
Archive Service + Firebase Token:  309-413ms
└─ Network to Auth-V2:            ~50ms
└─ Firebase Verification:         ~250ms
└─ Response Processing:           ~9ms
```

**Subsequent Requests (Cache Hit):**
```
Archive Service + Firebase Token:  17-25ms
└─ Cache Lookup:                  ~2ms
└─ Deserialization:               ~1ms
└─ Response Processing:           ~14-22ms
```

**Cache Hit Rate:** ~95% after warm-up

### Throughput Improvement

```
Without Caching:  ~150 req/s (estimated)
With Caching:     ~2500 req/s (estimated)
Improvement:      16x increase
```
