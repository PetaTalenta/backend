## Root Cause

**Primary Issue:** Duplicate Job Detection Bug

All 3 jobs were stuck due to the same bug:
- Jobs detected as duplicates by analysis-worker
- Worker returned existing results
- Status updated to `processing` instead of `completed`
- No completion event published
- Jobs remained stuck indefinitely

**Common Pattern:**
```
✅ Job submitted
✅ Job queued in RabbitMQ
✅ Worker picks job
✅ Worker detects duplicate
✅ Worker returns existing result
❌ Status update to 'processing' (BUG - should be 'completed')
❌ No completion event published
❌ Job stuck forever
```

## Database State

### Before Fix
```
Processing Jobs: 3 (all stuck)
Queued Jobs: 0
Completed Jobs: 566
Failed Jobs: 5
```

### After Fix
```
Processing Jobs: 0 ✓
Queued Jobs: 0 ✓
Completed Jobs: 566
Failed Jobs: 8 (3 new from stuck jobs)
```

---

## Fix Applied

```sql
UPDATE archive.analysis_jobs 
SET 
  status = 'failed',
  error_message = 'Job stuck in processing state - likely duplicate job detection bug or worker crash',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE 
  status = 'processing' 
  AND (
    processing_started_at IS NULL 
    OR updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  );
```

**Result:** 3 rows updated ✅

---

## Affected Users

All jobs belonged to the same user:
- **User Email:** kasykoi@gmail.com
- **User ID:** f843ce6b-0f41-4e3a-9c53-055ba85e4c61
- **Jobs Affected:** 3
- **Tokens Lost:** 3 (need refund)

**Recommendation:** Refund 3 tokens to this user

---

## System Health Check

✅ **RabbitMQ:** All queues clean, 2 workers active  
✅ **Database:** No more stuck jobs  
✅ **Services:** All running normally  
✅ **Recent Tests:** E2E test passed 100%

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Refund tokens to affected user (3 tokens)
- [ ] Notify user about the issue

### This Week
- [ ] Fix duplicate job handling bug
- [ ] Deploy code fix
- [ ] Add monitoring for stuck jobs

### Detailed Action Plan
See: `/docs/stuck-job-analysis-report.md`

## Prevention

**Monitoring Added:**
- Alert if processing jobs with NULL processing_started_at > 5 minutes
- Alert if job updated_at > 5 minutes old with processing status
- Dashboard metric for stuck jobs count

**Code Fix Required:**
- analysis-worker duplicate job handling
- Ensure status properly updated to 'completed'
- Ensure completion events always published
