## System Health

All components are healthy:
- ✅ Auth V2 Service
- ✅ PostgreSQL (1 connection, 0 waiting)
- ✅ Redis (Status: ready)
- ✅ Firebase (Initialized)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Old Auth Service Connection** (Minor)
   - Cannot connect from outside Docker network
   - Expected behavior - service is functional within Docker

2. **Cross-Compatibility** (Documented)
   - Users from old auth cannot login via new auth
   - Solution planned for Phase 5 (User Migration)

---

## Deliverables

✅ Comprehensive test suite (`tests/phase4-comprehensive-test.js`)  
✅ Test execution report (`tests/phase4-test-report.json`)  
✅ Detailed report (`docs/AUTH_V2_PHASE4_REPORT.md`)  
✅ Bug fixes (Username uniqueness)  
✅ Updated comprehensive plan

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Migration & Deployment
- Production deployment
- Gradual traffic migration (10% → 50% → 100%)
- User migration from old auth
- Monitoring setup

### Estimated Duration
10 business days
