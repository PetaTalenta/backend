# Investigation Report: Kasykoi Stuck Processing Jobs

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Investigator:** System Administrator  
**User Affected:** kasykoi@gmail.com  
**Issue:** Two analysis jobs stuck in "processing" status  

## Summary

Two analysis jobs for user kasykoi@gmail.com were stuck in "processing" status despite having completion timestamps and associated analysis results. Investigation revealed these were incomplete analysis results caused by AI service timeouts during the result generation phase.

## Affected Jobs

1. **Job ID:** `3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226`
   - Created: 2025-09-27 17:23:28
   - Completed At: 2025-09-29 02:17:48.501
   - Result ID: `deea4bc6-67ce-41d5-a8ac-05e0ad8ca62a`

2. **Job ID:** `7145057e-1e6f-4a0c-8ba0-0d4d255c5835`
   - Created: 2025-09-27 17:01:13
   - Completed At: 2025-09-29 02:31:56.391
   - Result ID: `daa65098-dead-4a98-8eb0-ed61cf8e4829`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
Both jobs suffered from **incomplete AI processing** where:
1. The analysis worker successfully processed the test data (`test_data` field populated)
2. The AI service call timed out or failed during persona profile generation
3. Analysis results were created with `test_result` = NULL
4. Jobs were later detected as duplicates and returned the incomplete results
5. Status update to "completed" happened despite the incomplete analysis

### Evidence from Logs
```
] Duplicate job detected - recently processed (user:f843ce6b) | currentJobId=3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226 originalJobId=3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226
] [3109a21e] Returning existing result for duplicate job | originalJobId=3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226 originalResultId=deea4bc6-67ce-41d5-a8ac-05e0ad8ca62a

] [7145057e] Returning existing result for duplicate job | originalJobId=7145057e-1e6f-4a0c-8ba0-0d4d255c5835 originalResultId=daa65098-dead-4a98-8eb0-ed61cf8e4829
```

### Database Analysis
- Both analysis results had `test_data` populated with complete assessment data
- Both analysis results had `test_result` = NULL (incomplete processing)
- Jobs had `completed_at` timestamps but status remained "processing"
- Since September 27th: 10 out of 23 analysis results have NULL `test_result` (43% failure rate)

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Status Correction**: Updated both jobs from "processing" to "failed" status
2. **Error Documentation**: Added descriptive error messages explaining the root cause
3. **Database Query Verification**: Confirmed no other users have similar stuck processing jobs

### SQL Commands Executed
```sql
-- Update job status to failed with explanation
UPDATE archive.analysis_jobs 
SET status = 'failed', 
    error_message = 'Analysis result incomplete - test_result is NULL. Original job may have timed out during AI processing phase.' 
WHERE job_id IN ('3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226', '7145057e-1e6f-4a0c-8ba0-0d4d255c5835');
```

## Systemic Issues Identified

### 1. Incomplete Result Handling
- Analysis results are created even when AI processing fails
- No validation to ensure `test_result` is populated before marking jobs as completed
- Deduplication service returns incomplete results without validation

### 2. Status Update Logic Gap
- Jobs can be marked as "processing" but never properly transition to "failed" when AI service fails
- Race condition between result creation and status updates

### 3. Error Recovery Problems
- Failed AI processing doesn't properly clean up partial results
- No retry mechanism for incomplete analysis results

## Recommended Long-term Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Add Result Validation**: Implement validation in `saveAnalysisResult` to ensure `test_result` is not NULL before saving
2. **Fix Status Update Logic**: Update analysis jobs to "failed" when `test_result` is NULL
3. **Improve Deduplication**: Validate result completeness before returning existing results

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add alerts for jobs with NULL `test_result`
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for incomplete results
3. **Cleanup Task**: Scheduled task to identify and fix incomplete results

### Low Priority
1. **Metrics Dashboard**: Track analysis completion vs failure rates
2. **User Notification**: Inform users when analysis fails due to technical issues

## Impact Assessment

- **Users Affected**: 1 (kasykoi@gmail.com)
- **Jobs Affected**: 2 analysis jobs
- **Service Availability**: No downtime
- **Data Integrity**: Partially compromised (incomplete results)
- **User Experience**: Negative (jobs appeared stuck)

## Prevention Measures

1. **Validation at Save**: Add `test_result` validation before saving analysis results
2. **Better Error Handling**: Ensure failed AI processing doesn't create partial results
3. **Status Synchronization**: Improve job status updates to reflect actual analysis state
4. **Monitoring**: Add alerts for stuck processing jobs

## Verification

After applying fixes:
- ✅ Both jobs correctly marked as "failed"
- ✅ No other users have similar stuck processing jobs
- ✅ Error messages clearly explain the issue
- ✅ Database consistency restored

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: Review analysis worker code for similar issues
2. **Implement Validation**: Add `test_result` validation in next release
3. **Monitor System**: Watch for similar issues in the coming days
4. **User Communication**: Consider notifying affected user about the issue
