## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Issues

**auth-service (Legacy System)**
- ❌ Custom JWT implementation requires maintenance
- ❌ Session management complexity
- ❌ No built-in OAuth/social login support
- ❌ Password reset logic fully self-managed
- ❌ Security updates require manual implementation
- ❌ No multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- ❌ Scalability concerns with session storage

**auth-v2-service (Current State)**
- ✅ Firebase Authentication integrated
- ✅ OAuth/social login ready
- ✅ Modern security practices
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No PostgreSQL integration ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 2)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Cannot store business data (token_balance, user_type) ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 2)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Other services cannot verify Firebase tokens ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 3)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No user federation between Firebase and PostgreSQL ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 2)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: ⚠️ OLD USERS CANNOT LOGIN - See [User Migration Strategy](./AUTH_V2_USER_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)

### Business Impact

- **Cannot replace auth-service** - Other services depend on PostgreSQL user data
- **Cannot scale** - Dual authentication systems increase complexity
- **Technical debt** - Maintaining two auth systems
- **User experience** - Cannot provide modern auth features (social login, MFA)
- **Security risk** - Old auth-service may have unpatched vulnerabilities

### Root Cause

Auth-v2-service was designed as authentication-only service (Firebase wrapper) without considering:
1. Business data storage requirements (token_balance, user_type, etc.) ✅ RESOLVED
2. Inter-service token verification needs ✅ RESOLVED
3. User data federation between Firebase and PostgreSQL ✅ RESOLVED
4. Backward compatibility with existing services ✅ RESOLVED
5. **User migration from old auth-service** ⚠️ **CRITICAL BLOCKER** - Must be implemented before production

**🚨 BREAKING ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Users registered via old auth-service (email + password in PostgreSQL) **CANNOT login** via auth-v2-service because they don't exist in Firebase. This is a **blocking issue** for production deployment.

**Solution Required**: Implement hybrid authentication to migrate users on first login. See [AUTH_V2_USER_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md](./AUTH_V2_USER_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md) for detailed implementation plan.

## 🏗️ Target Architecture

### Architecture Vision

**Hybrid Authentication System**
```
Firebase Authentication (SSO) + PostgreSQL (Business Data) = Production Ready
```

### Component Roles

| Component | Responsibility | Data Storage |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Firebase Auth** | Authentication (login/signup/OAuth) | User credentials, profiles |
| **PostgreSQL** | Business data (token_balance, type) | User business info |
| **auth-v2-service** | Token verification, user federation | None (stateless) |
| **Redis** | Token cache, session data | Temporary cache |

### Data Flow

**Authentication Flow**
```
1. User logs in → Firebase Auth
2. Firebase returns ID token
3. Client sends token to auth-v2-service
4. auth-v2-service verifies with Firebase
5. Lazy create/update user in PostgreSQL
6. Return user data + cached token
```

**Authorization Flow (Inter-Service)**
```
1. Service receives request with Firebase token
2. Service calls auth-v2-service /verify-token
3. auth-v2-service checks cache → Firebase → PostgreSQL
4. Returns user data for authorization
5. Service makes business logic decision
```

### Database Schema Design

**New Columns Added to auth.users**
- `firebase_uid` (VARCHAR 128, UNIQUE, NULLABLE) - Link to Firebase user
- `auth_provider` (VARCHAR 20, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'local') - 'local' | 'firebase' | 'hybrid'
- `provider_data` (JSONB, NULLABLE) - Provider-specific metadata
- `last_firebase_sync` (TIMESTAMP, NULLABLE) - Last sync timestamp
- `federation_status` (VARCHAR 20, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'active') - 'active' | 'syncing' | 'failed' | 'disabled'

**Modified Columns**
- `password_hash` (VARCHAR 255, NULLABLE) - Now optional for Firebase users

**Indexes**
- `idx_users_firebase_uid` - Fast lookup by Firebase UID
- `idx_users_auth_provider` - Filter by provider type
- `idx_users_federation_status` - Monitor sync issues

**Constraints**
- `chk_auth_provider` - Validate provider values
- `chk_federation_status` - Validate federation status
- `chk_password_hash_required` - Password required for local users only
- `chk_firebase_uid_format` - Firebase UID format validation (length >= 20)

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Lazy User Creation**
- Users created in PostgreSQL only when first accessed
- Reduces database load
- Faster authentication (no DB write on login)

**2. Dual Mode Support**
- Support both JWT (old) and Firebase tokens (new) during migration
- Gradual migration without downtime
- Fallback to old auth-service if needed

**3. Token Verification Caching**
- Cache verified tokens in Redis (5-minute TTL)
- Reduce Firebase API calls
- Improve response time (<50ms for cached tokens)

**4. User Data Federation**
- Firebase as single source of truth for auth
- PostgreSQL mirrors essential business data
- Periodic sync to handle drift

- ✅ **Pre-Migration**
  - Multiple database backups (automated + manual)
  - Test migrations on staging environment 3+ times
  - Verify rollback procedure works
  - Document every step of migration
  - Schedule migration during low-traffic window

- ✅ **During Migration**
  - Run migrations in transactions (atomic)
  - Validate each step before proceeding
  - Monitor database logs in real-time
  - Have DBA on standby
  - Stop migration immediately if errors detected

- ✅ **Post-Migration**
  - Run verification queries immediately
  - Check data integrity (row counts, constraints)
  - Test application functionality
  - Monitor for 2 hours before declaring success
  - Keep backup accessible for 7 days

**Rollback Plan**:
1. Stop all applications connecting to database
