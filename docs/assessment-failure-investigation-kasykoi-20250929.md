# Investigation Report: Assessment Failures for kasykoi@gmail.com

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Investigator**: AI Assistant  
**Issue**: Failed assessments and retry endpoint problems for user kasykoi@gmail.com

## Executive Summary

Investigation into 5 recent assessments for kasykoi@gmail.com revealed multiple failure patterns. Out of 5 assessments, 2 failed completely and there were significant issues with the retry functionality. The root causes include Google AI service 503 errors, Archive Service connectivity issues, and poor error handling in the retry endpoint.

## Investigation Findings

### Assessment History Analysis

**Database Query Results** (5 most recent assessments):
1. `ed2b010f-d91e-4fc5-a359-837b601b761f` - **COMPLETED** (2025-09-28 17:51:15)
2. `de950185-84bc-42d9-88d0-221c6d9302ae` - **COMPLETED** (2025-09-27 17:23:28) ⚠️ *Has error message*
3. `a868a91a-023f-4793-b0c1-2c90bd39c469` - **PROCESSING** (2025-09-27 17:16:18) ⚠️ *Has error message*
4. `72f7be15-5952-4af4-a562-0ecd0a6b93c7` - **COMPLETED** (2025-09-27 17:01:13)
5. `27ef5715-35e4-4a12-820c-abecfb5f93af` - **COMPLETED** (2025-09-27 16:57:40)

**Key Discovery**: Jobs marked as "COMPLETED" can still have error messages, indicating they failed but the status wasn't properly updated to "failed".

### Error Pattern Analysis

**Primary Error Type**: Google AI Service 503 Errors
```
Assessment analysis failed for AI-Driven Talent Mapping: Talent mapping analysis failed: got status: 503 Service Unavailable. {"error":{"code":503,"message":"The service is currently unavailable.","status":"UNAVAILABLE"}}
```

**Secondary Error Type**: Rate Limiting
```
Rate limit exceeded: USER_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
```

### Critical Retry Endpoint Failure

**Job ID**: `3109a21e-69b8-4e34-acac-e6d3388fe226`  
**Timestamp**: September 28, 2025 17:51:57  
**Critical Error**:
```
[ERROR] [3109a21e] Failed to update job status for retry, refunding tokens | error=Request failed with status code 500
[ERROR] Unhandled error occurred (user:f843ce6b) | error=Failed to update job for retry
```

**Impact**: The retry endpoint failed at Step 6 (updating job status to 'processing') in the Archive Service, causing:
- User received HTTP 503 error instead of successful retry response
- Token was deducted then refunded due to failure
- Job remained in failed state despite retry attempt

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Google AI Service Instability
- **Issue**: Multiple 503 Service Unavailable errors from Google Gemini API
- **Impact**: Assessments fail during AI processing phase
- **Frequency**: Affecting multiple assessments over 2-day period

### 2. Archive Service Connectivity Issues
- **Issue**: Archive Service returning HTTP 500 errors intermittently
- **Impact**: Jobs cannot be updated to proper status, retry endpoint fails
- **Evidence**: Multiple "Request failed with status code 500" errors

### 3. RabbitMQ Connection Problems
- **Issue**: Persistent RabbitMQ connection/channel closure warnings
- **Impact**: Message queue instability, potential job processing delays

### 4. Poor Error Handling in Retry Endpoint
- **Issue**: Retry endpoint fails silently at job status update step
- **Code Location**: `/assessment-service/src/routes/assessments.js` lines 356-382
- **Problem**: When Archive Service returns 500 error, the entire retry operation fails

## Technical Details

### Database Inconsistencies
- Jobs with status="completed" but containing error_message
- One job stuck in "processing" status despite having error_message
- Job `a868a91a-023f-4793-b0c1-2c90bd39c469` shows processing but has 503 error

### Service Dependencies Chain
1. **Assessment Service** → Archive Service (job status updates)
2. **Analysis Worker** → Google AI Service (analysis processing)  
3. **Analysis Worker** → Archive Service (result storage)
4. **All Services** → RabbitMQ (message queue)

Failure in any dependency can cause cascading issues.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Archive Service Stability**
   - Investigate Archive Service 500 errors
   - Implement connection pooling and retry logic
   - Add circuit breaker pattern

2. **Improve Retry Endpoint Error Handling**
   - Add better transaction handling in retry endpoint
   - Implement rollback mechanism when job status update fails
   - Return proper error responses instead of 503

3. **Database Consistency Cleanup**
   - Update job `a868a91a-023f-4793-b0c1-2c90bd39c469` status from "processing" to "failed"
   - Add database constraints to prevent status/error_message inconsistencies

### Medium Priority

4. **Google AI Service Resilience**
   - Implement exponential backoff for 503 errors
   - Add fallback AI providers or degraded service mode
   - Improve rate limiting handling

5. **RabbitMQ Stability**
   - Investigate connection closure root cause
   - Implement proper connection recovery
   - Add connection health monitoring

### Long Term

6. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Add alerts for Archive Service failures
   - Monitor AI service error rates
   - Track retry endpoint success rates

7. **Status Management Improvements**
   - Implement proper state machine for job statuses
   - Add status validation constraints in database
   - Better separation of processing status vs completion status

## Affected Services

- ✅ **Assessment Service**: Retry endpoint failures, error handling issues
- ✅ **Archive Service**: HTTP 500 errors, connectivity problems  
- ✅ **Analysis Worker**: Google AI 503 handling, status update failures
- ✅ **RabbitMQ**: Connection stability issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test Archive Service under load to reproduce 500 errors
2. Simulate Google AI 503 errors to verify retry behavior
3. Test retry endpoint with various failure scenarios
4. Verify database consistency after various failure modes
