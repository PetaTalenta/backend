# Unified Authentication Migration Plan

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Duration:** 3 weeks

## Problem

Auth-v2 service sudah menggunakan Firebase authentication, namun services lain hanya menerima JWT dari legacy auth-service. User dengan Firebase token tidak bisa mengakses service-service tersebut.

## Objective

Semua microservices harus dapat menerima **dual authentication**:- User journey tracking (correlation IDs)
- Performance tracing integration

#### 3.4 Final Documentation & Validation (Day 5)

**Documentation Updates**:
- [ ] Update all API documentation
- [ ] Finalize migration guide for developers
- [ ] Update operations runbook
- [ ] Complete architecture diagrams
- [ ] Publish deprecation timeline

**Final Validation**:
- [ ] Run full integration test suite
- [ ] Verify all services migrated (100%)
- [ ] Confirm metrics within targets
- [ ] Validate monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Conduct post-implementation review

#### Phase 3 Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Auth latency optimized (<150ms p95)
- ✅ Deprecation plan published and communicated
- ✅ JWT usage tracking enabled
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard complete
- ✅ Alerts configured and tested
- ✅ All documentation updated and published
- ✅ Post-implementation review completedID Token dan Legacy JWT, dengan automatic fallback dan zero downtime migration.

**Target:**
- 100% services support dual authentication
- <200ms auth latency (p95)
- >99.5% token acceptance rate
- Zero production downtime

## Architecture Concept

### Current State
```
API Gateway → Auth-V2 (Firebase) ✓
           → Legacy Services (JWT only) ✗ Firebase tokens rejected
```

### Target State
```
API Gateway → All Services accept:
              - Firebase ID Token (via Auth-V2)
              - Legacy JWT Token (via Auth-Service)
              - Automatic detection & fallback
```

### Authentication Flow Concept
1. Extract Bearer token
2. Detect token type (Firebase vs JWT by pattern)
3. Verify with appropriate service (Auth-V2 or Auth-Service)
4. Fallback to alternative if primary fails
5. Attach user context or return 401

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### Objectives
- Validate current implementation and prepare migration toolkit
- Migrate critical path services (API Gateway, Auth Service, Admin Service)
- Ensure zero downtime during migration
- Establish rollback procedures

#### Preparation Tasks (Day 1)
- [ ] **Audit Current State**
  - Inventory all services and their auth implementations
  - Document current token flows and endpoints
  - Validate reference implementation (archive-service, assessment-service, chatbot-service)
  
- [ ] **Prepare Migration Kit**
  - Extract unifiedAuthService.js as template
  - Create auth middleware template
  - Prepare environment variable templates
  
- [ ] **Set Up Monitoring**
  - Add auth metrics to Prometheus/Grafana
  - Set up alerts for auth failures
  - Create dashboard for migration tracking

#### 1.1 API Gateway Migration (Days 2-3)

**Why Critical**: All traffic flows through API Gateway. Must support both token types for downstream services.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add unified auth service to API Gateway
- [ ] Update authentication middleware
- [ ] Add token type detection and routing
- [ ] Update header forwarding (X-User-ID, X-Token-Type)
- [ ] Add auth metrics logging

**Environment Variables**:
```
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-service:3001
AUTH_V2_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-v2-service:3008
AUTH_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
AUTH_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
```

**Testing**:
- [ ] Unit tests for token detection
- [ ] Integration tests with Firebase tokens
- [ ] Integration tests with JWT tokens
- [ ] Load tests (1000 req/s benchmark)
- [ ] Fallback mechanism tests

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep old middleware as `auth.legacy.js`
- Feature flag: `USE_UNIFIED_AUTH=true/false`
- Quick revert via environment variable

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Auth success rate (target: >99.5%)
- Auth latency p50/p95/p99 (target: <200ms p95)
- Token type distribution (Firebase vs JWT)
- Fallback invocation rate
- Error rate by token type

#### 1.2 Auth Service Enhancement (Day 4)

**Why Important**: Legacy auth service needs to coexist and potentially verify Firebase tokens.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Firebase Admin SDK to auth-service (optional)
- [ ] Create `/auth/verify-unified` endpoint
- [ ] Add token type detection
- [ ] Update existing `/auth/verify-token` for compatibility
- [ ] Add metrics and logging

**Decision Point**: 
- **Option A**: Auth-service forwards Firebase tokens to Auth-V2 (recommended)
- **Option B**: Auth-service verifies Firebase tokens directly (redundant)

**Recommended**: Option A - Keep separation of concerns

**Testing**:
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility (existing JWT flows)
- [ ] Test forwarding to Auth-V2
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Circuit breaker tests (Auth-V2 down scenario)

- Performance benchmarks
- Circuit breaker tests (Auth-V2 down scenario)

#### 1.3 Admin Service Migration (Day 5)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Copy unified auth service from archive-service
- [ ] Update auth middleware
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Update admin role checks (user_type field)
- [ ] Test admin panel login with Firebase tokens

**Testing**:
- [ ] Admin login with Firebase token
- [ ] Admin operations with both token types
- [ ] Role-based access control verification

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Token Validation Requirements

#### Firebase ID Token Validation
- **Issuer Check**: Must be from `securetoken.google.com/{project-id}`
- **Audience Check**: Must match Firebase project ID
- **Expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour
- **Signature**: Verified against Google's public keys
- **Claims**: Extract UID, email, email_verified

#### JWT Token Validation (Legacy)
- **Secret**: Validate against `JWT_SECRET`
- **Expiration**: Check token not expired
- **Payload**: Verify required claims exist
- **Issuer**: Validate issuer matches expected value

### Security Best Practices
- [ ] Never log full tokens (only first 10 chars)
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all auth service communication
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Add request signing for service-to-service calls
- [ ] Rotate JWT_SECRET periodically
- [ ] Monitor for unusual auth patterns
- [ ] Implement token revocation mechanism
- [ ] Use short-lived tokens (1 hour max)

### Compliance
- [ ] GDPR: Log retention policies (30-90 days max)
- [ ] SOC 2: Audit trail for all auth events
- [ ] PCI: Secure token storage (if applicable)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

#### Unit Tests (70% coverage target)
**Per Service**:
- Token detection logic
- Firebase token verification
- JWT token verification
- Fallback mechanism
- Error handling
- User object mapping

**Test Cases**:
```javascript
describe('Unified Auth Service', () => {
  // Token Detection
  test('detects Firebase ID token correctly')
  test('detects JWT token correctly')
  test('handles malformed tokens')
  
  // Verification
  test('verifies valid Firebase token')
  test('verifies valid JWT token')
  test('rejects expired Firebase token')
  test('rejects expired JWT token')
  test('rejects invalid signature')
  
  // Fallback
  test('falls back to JWT when Firebase fails')
  test('falls back to Firebase when JWT fails')
  test('returns error when both fail')
  
  // Performance
  test('completes verification in <200ms')
  test('handles concurrent requests')
});
```

#### Integration Tests (20% coverage target)
**Cross-Service Tests**:
- End-to-end authentication flow
- API Gateway → Service → Auth verification
- Token forwarding via headers
- Service-to-service authentication
- Error propagation

**Test Scenarios**:
- User logs in via Auth-V2 (Firebase) → Gets Firebase token → Calls service → Success
- User logs in via Auth (Legacy) → Gets JWT → Calls service → Success
- User with expired Firebase token → Gets 401
- User with expired JWT → Gets 401
- Auth-V2 down → Fallback works
- Auth service down → Fallback works

#### Load Tests (Performance validation)
**Scenarios**:
- Baseline: 1000 req/s with JWT tokens
- Target: 1000 req/s with 50% Firebase / 50% JWT
- Spike: 5000 req/s mixed tokens
- Sustained: 2000 req/s for 1 hour

**Metrics**:
- Success rate > 99.5%
- Latency p95 < 200ms
- Error rate < 0.5%
- No memory leaks
- No connection pool exhaustion

#### Chaos Engineering (Resilience validation)
**Tests**:
- Kill Auth-V2 service during traffic
- Kill Auth service during traffic
- Introduce network latency (100ms, 500ms, 1s)
- Return random 500 errors from auth services
- Simulate DB connection failures

**Expected Behavior**:
- Fallback mechanism activates
- Partial degradation, not total failure
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Services recover automatically
- Monitoring captures incidents

## 🎓 Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### From Reference Implementation (Archive/Assessment/Chatbot Services)

#### What Worked Well
1. **Token Detection Logic**: Automatic detection based on token format reduces complexity
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Trying both verifications ensures high availability
3. **Logging**: Detailed logs help debug token issues quickly
4. **Environment Variables**: Easy configuration across environments

#### What Could Be Improved
1. **Token Caching**: Could reduce latency for repeated requests
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Should add to prevent cascading failures
3. **Metrics**: Need more granular metrics for monitoring
4. **Error Messages**: More specific error codes for clients

### Best Practices for New Migrations

#### Code Organization
- Keep `unifiedAuthService.js` separate and reusable
- Maintain single responsibility in auth middleware
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Version your auth logic (v1, v2, etc.)

#### Testing
- Test both token types in every test suite
- Include performance tests in CI/CD
- Test fallback scenarios explicitly
- Mock auth services for faster tests

#### Deployment
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Deploy to staging first, always
- Monitor for 24-48 hours after deployment
- Have rollback script ready before deployment

#### Monitoring
- Log every auth attempt with token type
- Track auth latency per service
- Alert on auth success rate drops
- Dashboard for real-time visibility
